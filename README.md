## Sortable

Sortable is an open-source JavaScript and CSS library which adds sorting
functionality to tables. It is tiny (`<2kb` min+gzip) and has no dependencies.

It was originally forked off of https://github.com/HubSpot/sortable, which
hasn't been touched in ~5 years as of this writing.

It now has a few hacks.
